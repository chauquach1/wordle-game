WORDLE: A single-player guessing game where a player has (6) guesses to guess the secret (5) letter word. With every entry, a player's guess can give them hints as to which letters are included in the secret wordle. Upon each guess submission, a letter may turn "Green" if it is present and in the correct position as it would be in the secret word. A letter may turn "Yellow" if it is present in the wordle, but it is in the incorrect position. A "Gray" tile means that the letter is either not included and/or it has reached it's maximum number of occurences in the secret wordle.
